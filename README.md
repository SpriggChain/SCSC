# SCSC
The Sprigg Chain Citizen Science Project (SCSC)

The goals of SCSC

To create a connection between citizens and science
To apply blockchain applications to research projects

The SCSC initial coin offering (ICO) will create a community of citizen scientists and a funding pool to develop research projects that utilize blockchain applications.
  
 SCSC projects will be divided into categories including Ocean, Air, Earth and Tech. 
 
SCSC ICO community members can engage in SCSC projects in a variety of ways.  Some projects may allow direct participation, such as photographing and documenting shark sightings.  Other participation may include creating awareness and engagement with a project by combining the project with decentralized prediction markets, such as Augur, to “predict” aspects of the project.  For example, in a shark tagging project, participants can speculate on when and where Shark A will be tracked next.  This speculation adds value to the project by creating awareness of the project topic (share migration) and also allows the speculators to categorize existing shark migration data, such as previous sightings, time between sightings, and other factors,  to develop the market, which can be made available to scientists for other research data.
